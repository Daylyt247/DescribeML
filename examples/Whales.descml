        Main Description: 
            Purposes: "A dataset of 633 annotated whale objects, created by surveying 6,300 km2 of satellite imagery captured by various very high-resolution satellites (i.e. WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GeoEye-1 and Quickbird-2) in various regions across the globe (e.g. Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa, United States, Mexico). The dataset covers four different species: southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), and grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus)."

            Additional Conditions: "To fulfil the End User Licence Agreement with Maxar Technologies18, these image chips are shared in a png format, and access to the dataset is available upon request from the NERC UK Polar Data Centre that can be contacted at PDCServiceDesk@bas.ac.uk. Data access requires user name and email address, which will be shared with Maxar Technologies. Anyone using any of the image chips is also required to attribute the images
            properly (See Usage Notes)."

            Version lifecycle: "As we acquire and analyse more satellite imagery, we aim to annually
            update the Whales from Space dataset. The updates will be available under the Whales from Space dataset deposited
            on the NERC Polar Data Centre repository16,17 to ensure consistency and long-term public availability of the
            data."
    Composition:
        Rationale: "The “Whales from space dataset” is separated in two sub-datasets: a dataset that contains the whale annotations (box and point shapefiles with associated csv files) named “Whales from space dataset: Box and point shapefiles”16; and a dataset with the image chips named
            “Whales from space dataset: Image chips”17. The “Whales from space dataset: Box and point shapefiles” dataset can be accessed on the NERC UK Polar Data Centre directly using the DOI link (https://doi.org/10.5285/
            C1AFE32C-493C-4DC7-AF9F-649593B97B2C). This dataset contains nine shapefiles with boxes centered on each whale and nine point shapefiles marking each individual detected whales (Table 2) totalling 633 annotated whale objects (Table 3 and Fig. 4). This dataset also includes four csv files: 1) a csv file joining all the attribute tables linked to every box and point shapefiles for whale objects (WhaleFromSpaceDB_Whales.csv); 2) a second
            csv file explaining each column of the first csv file (WhaleFromSpace_Guidance.csv); and 3) two other csv files describe the naming of each box (WhaleFromSpaceDB_BoxNaming.csv) and each point (WhaleFromSpaceDB_ PointNaming.csv).                                      Each box and point has metadata associated to it, which is included in the attribute table associated to the specific shapefile. It contains information about the detected whale: certainty level (i.e. “definite”, “probable”, “possible”) derived from the classification score assessed based on various criteria (i.e. body length, body width, body shape, body colour, flukeprint, blow, contour, wake, after-breach, defecation, other disturbance, fluke, flipper, head callosities and mudtrail) following Cubaynes et al.1 method, most likely species, and potential
            other species. For each annotated whale, we also provide information about the imagery analysed: the location, latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees and recorded using the same geographic coordinate system and projection as the satellite imagery), imagery ID, imagery date, type of satellite, spatial resolution, number of
            multispectral bands, product level and type (e.g. Standard2A). The size of each boxes was also specified in terms
            of pixels."

        choice of imagery was linked to other projects1,3,7,8 or specifically acquired to enlarge the database. Some images

            Description: "For each detected whale, a point was placed on it with associated metadata (see Data description).
            Boxes were created around each point indicating a whale object using ArcGIS 10.4 ESRI 2017, and following the workflow
            illustrated in Fig. 2. We created square boxes with a power of 2 (i.e. 128 × 128 pixels) to facilitate its use for machine learning approaches,
            particularly deep learning algorithms. Each whale object was represented by a point and a box (delimiting the pixels in the pansharpened image).
            The boxes created around the whale object were saved as one shapefile (a georeferenced file) per satellite image, as the coordinate system varied 
            from one image to the next (Table 2), similarly for points. With the exception of the four satellite images of the Pelagos Sanctuary, for which one
            box and one point shapefile were created for the four images."

        Applications:
            Past Uses: "Yes. The 2020 SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification challenge dataset 
            was created for the purpose of conducting a machine learning competition to 
            identify melanoma in lesion images. The competition was launched on DATE on 
            the Kaggle platform and ran through DATE. You can learn more about the competition
            and results here: LINK"
            Recommended: 
                "Identify melanoma in lesion images" 
                "Predict incidence of melanoma in a population"
            Non-recommended: "Due to low population prevalence and challenges with access 
            to care in different populations, the images gathered for large datasets such
            as this for AI classification have a strong tendency to under-represent darker
            skin types. This may lead to either overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of melanomas
            in darker skin types, both of which would have significant clinical implications
            and will require prospective study. The ISIC Archive is actively pursuing methods
            by which to increase the diversity of images obtained, but at this point
            caution should be used when attempting to generalize algorithms trained on
            images from specialized referral centers (such as the dataset described herein) 
            to the global population at large. The dataset is also enriched for melanoma in 
            general and does not represent true incidence of melanoma."

    Composition:
        Rationale: 
            "There is one instance that represent images from skin of patatients in coalition with some labels identifyng the patient.

            Metadata for each image included approximate patient age at time of image capture, biological sex, general anatomic site 
            of the lesion, anonymized patient identification number, benign/malignant category, and the specific diagnosis if one was 
            available based on an acceptable ground truth confirmation method.

            Images from the same patient are indicated through a unique patient identifier (field name patient_id). The dataset represents 
            2,056 patients from three continents with an average of 16 lesions per patient, consisting of 33,126 dermoscopic images and 584 
            histopathologically confirmed melanomas compared with benign melanoma mimickers. This example has been sammpled to 12023 dermoscopis samples"

                evaluated to ensure that it is fit for purpose. We queried clinical imaging databases containing 
                images from 1998 to 2019 across the six centers to generate a multicenter imaging dataset. 
                Images that met the selection criteria were added to the imaging dataset and underwent a quality 
                assurance review to validate their inclusion in the dataset." 

        Data Splits:
            "Yes. In order to test algorithm generalizability, a subset of images from six sites (five geographic locations)

             without target information."

                Description: 
                "A software annotation tool, called â€˜Tagger,â€™ was developed internally to review diagnostic labeling of grouped images 13. 
                Using this tool, dermoscopy expert reviewers (EC, OR) were presented sets of 30 images with a shared diagnosis in order to 
                identify the ones with erroneous labeling. Reviewers invested 22 hours over three weeks of quality assurance in â€˜Taggerâ€™ and 
                spent an average of 4 seconds per set when flagging a single image, and 11 seconds per set when flagging several images. Out 
                of all images reviewed in Tagger, 2.7% were removed, out of concern for erroneous labels.

                The ground truth labels for all malignant lesions in the dataset were confirmed via retrospective review of histopathology 
                reports, and diagnosis plausibility was visually confirmed by visual confirmation of a dermoscopy expert. Histopathology reports 
                were double checked if the label was suspicious. Melanoma in situ and invasive melanoma were both coded as melanoma. All other 
                qualifying images were coded as benign, including those diagnosed as severely dysplastic nevi 23, 24.
                
                Non-biopsied lesions with expert consensus agreement and lesions followed for six months or more without malignant changes were 
                labelled benign without a more specific diagnosis by most contributors. Dermatofibromas, seborrheic keratosis, or vascular lesions 
                were not monitored, as that would not reflect clinical practice, but labels were verified visually by an expert in dermoscopy. 
                Images of lesions were attributed to patients based on the clinical imaging database identification codes which are stored at the 
                time of capture during each clinical photography session."

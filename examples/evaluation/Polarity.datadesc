        Description:  
            Purpose: "
                The dataset was created to enable research on predicting sentiment polarity—i.e., given a piece of English text, predict whether
                it has a positive or negative affect—or stance—toward its topic.The dataset was created intentionally with that task in mind, 
                focusing on movie reviews as a place where affect/sentiment is frequently expressed."

         Description: 
            "The instances are movie reviews extracted from newsgroup postings,
            together with a sentiment polarity rating for whether the text
            corresponds to a review with a rating that is either strongly positive (high number of stars)
            or strongly negative (low number of  stars). The sentiment polarity rating is binary {positive, negative}."

                     Description: 
                        "Each instance consists of the text associated with the review, with
                        obvious ratings information removed from that text (some errors
                        were found and later fixed). The text was down-cased and HTML
                        tags were removed. Boilerplate newsgroup header/footer text was
                        removed. Some additional unspecified automatic filtering was
                        done. Each instance also has an associated target value: a positive
                        (+1) or negative (-1) sentiment polarity rating based on the number of 
                        stars that that review gave (details on the mapping from
                        number of stars to polarity is given below in “Data Preprocessing”).

                    "The sample of instances collected is English movie reviews from
                    the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup, from which a
                    “number of stars” rating could be extracted. The sample is limited
                    to forty reviews per unique author in order to achieve broader
                    coverage by authorship. Beyond that, the sample is arbitrary."

                    classification accuracy. "

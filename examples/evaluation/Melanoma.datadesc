        Description:
            Purpose:
                "The 2020 SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification challenge dataset
                was created for the purpose of conducting a machine learning
                competition to identify melanoma in lesion images.
                
                Due to low population prevalence and challenges with access to 
                care in different populations, the images gathered for large datasets
                such as this for AI classification have a strong tendency to under-represent
                darker skin types. This may lead to either overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis
                of melanomas in darker skin types, both of which would have significant
                clinical implications and will require prospective study. The ISIC Archive
                is actively pursuing methods by which to increase the diversity of images
                obtained, but at this point caution should be used when attempting to
                generalize algorithms trained on images from specialized referral centers
                (such as the dataset described herein) to the global population at large
                The dataset is also enriched for melanoma in general and does not represent
                true incidence of melanoma."

                the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to 
                advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and 
                innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the 
                International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort

            "There is one instance that represent images from skin of patatients in coalition with some labels identifyng the patient.

            Metadata for each image included approximate patient age at time of image capture, biological sex, general anatomic site 
            of the lesion, anonymized patient identification number, benign/malignant category, and the specific diagnosis if one was 
            available based on an acceptable ground truth confirmation method.

            Images from the same patient are indicated through a unique patient identifier (field name patient_id). The dataset represents 
            2,056 patients from three continents with an average of 16 lesions per patient, consisting of 33,126 dermoscopic images and 584 
            histopathologically confirmed melanomas compared with benign melanoma mimickers. This example has been sammpled to 12023 dermoscopis samples"

                 "1) We queried clinical imaging databases across the six centers to generate a multicenter imaging dataset. 
                 Images consisted of 12,743,090 pixels on average but ranged from 307,200 to 24,000,000. Among patients with 
                 dermoscopy imaging from 1998 to 2019, those with multiple skin lesions were identified.

                 2) Memorial Sloan Kettering: Images were acquired using a dermoscopic attachment to either a digital single reflex 
                 lens (SLR) camera or to a smartphone. Each lesion was imaged with polarized and/or nonpolarized dermoscopy. 
                 For each lesion, 3- 5 images are collected during each patient visit and stored in a specialized image database 
                 called VectraTM (Canfield Scientific Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA).
                 
                 3) Hospital Clinic Barcelona: The dermatology department is equipped with the digital dermatoscopy system 
                 MoleMaxTM HD (Derma Medical Systems, Vienna, Austria) and corresponding image database to store the collected images. 
                 Each lesion was photographed using polarized dermoscopy.
                 
                 4) University of Queensland: All images used for the studies were extracted from the VectraTM image database 
                 (Canfield Scientific Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA).
                 
                 5) Medical University Vienna: We extracted polarized dermoscopic images from 2015-2019 which were stored in the 
                 MoleMax HD System (Derma Medical Systems, Vienna, Austria).
                 
                 6) Melanoma Institute Australia and the Sydney Melanoma Diagnosis Centre: Images are acquired using a dermoscopic 
                 attachment to either a digital single reflex lens (SLR) camera or to a smartphone and stored in DermEngineTM 
                 (Metaoptima, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada).
                 
                 7) Once the images had been collected from all the various centers, a software annotation tool, called ‘Tagger,’
                  was developed internally to review diagnostic labeling of grouped images.
                 
                 8) Additional metadata including demographics of the patients was collected at each imaging center at the time 
                 the images were taken, method unclear."

                3) A software annotation tool, called ‘Tagger,’ was developed internally to review diagnostic labeling of grouped 
                images. Using this tool, dermoscopy expert reviewers (EC, OR) were presented sets of 30 images with a shared diagnosis
                in order to identify the ones with erroneous labeling. Reviewers invested 22 hours over three weeks of quality assurance
                in ‘Tagger’ and spent an average of 4 seconds per set when flagging a single image, and 11 seconds per set when flagging 
                several images. Out of all images reviewed in Tagger, 2.7% were removed, out of concern for erroneous labels.

                the class without a melanoma image. Lesions in both classes were subsampled through patient matching, which led to a loss 
                of 4.1% of images."

                The ground truth labels for all malignant lesions in the dataset were confirmed via retrospective review of histopathology 
                reports, and diagnosis plausibility was visually confirmed by visual confirmation of a dermoscopy expert. Histopathology reports 
                were double checked if the label was suspicious. Melanoma in situ and invasive melanoma were both coded as melanoma. All other 
                qualifying images were coded as benign, including those diagnosed as severely dysplastic nevi 23, 24.
                
                Non-biopsied lesions with expert consensus agreement and lesions followed for six months or more without malignant changes were 
                labelled benign without a more specific diagnosis by most contributors. Dermatofibromas, seborrheic keratosis, or vascular lesions 
                were not monitored, as that would not reflect clinical practice, but labels were verified visually by an expert in dermoscopy. 
                Images of lesions were attributed to patients based on the clinical imaging database identification codes which are stored at the 
                time of capture during each clinical photography session."

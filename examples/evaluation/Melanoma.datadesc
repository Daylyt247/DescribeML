        Description:
            Purpose:
                "The 2020 SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification challenge dataset
                was created for the purpose of conducting a machine learning
                competition to identify melanoma in lesion images.
                
                Due to low population prevalence and challenges with access to 
                care in different populations, the images gathered for large datasets
                such as this for AI classification have a strong tendency to under-represent
                darker skin types. This may lead to either overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis
                of melanomas in darker skin types, both of which would have significant
                clinical implications and will require prospective study. The ISIC Archive
                is actively pursuing methods by which to increase the diversity of images
                obtained, but at this point caution should be used when attempting to
                generalize algorithms trained on images from specialized referral centers
                (such as the dataset described herein) to the global population at large
                The dataset is also enriched for melanoma in general and does not represent
                true incidence of melanoma."

                "As the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging,
                the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to 
                advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and 
                innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the 
                International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort
                to improve melanoma diagnosis. "

    Composition:
        Rationale: 
            "There is one instance that represent images from skin of patatients in coalition with some labels identifyng the patient.

            Metadata for each image included approximate patient age at time of image capture, biological sex, general anatomic site 
            of the lesion, anonymized patient identification number, benign/malignant category, and the specific diagnosis if one was 
            available based on an acceptable ground truth confirmation method.

            Images from the same patient are indicated through a unique patient identifier (field name patient_id). The dataset represents 
            2,056 patients from three continents with an average of 16 lesions per patient, consisting of 33,126 dermoscopic images and 584 
            histopathologically confirmed melanomas compared with benign melanoma mimickers. This example has been sammpled to 12023 dermoscopis samples"

                "A software annotation tool, called ‘Tagger,’ was developed internally to review diagnostic labeling of grouped images 13. 
                Using this tool, dermoscopy expert reviewers (EC, OR) were presented sets of 30 images with a shared diagnosis in order to 
                identify the ones with erroneous labeling. Reviewers invested 22 hours over three weeks of quality assurance in ‘Tagger’ and 
                spent an average of 4 seconds per set when flagging a single image, and 11 seconds per set when flagging several images. Out 
                of all images reviewed in Tagger, 2.7% were removed, out of concern for erroneous labels.

                The ground truth labels for all malignant lesions in the dataset were confirmed via retrospective review of histopathology 
                reports, and diagnosis plausibility was visually confirmed by visual confirmation of a dermoscopy expert. Histopathology reports 
                were double checked if the label was suspicious. Melanoma in situ and invasive melanoma were both coded as melanoma. All other 
                qualifying images were coded as benign, including those diagnosed as severely dysplastic nevi 23, 24.
                
                Non-biopsied lesions with expert consensus agreement and lesions followed for six months or more without malignant changes were 
                labelled benign without a more specific diagnosis by most contributors. Dermatofibromas, seborrheic keratosis, or vascular lesions 
                were not monitored, as that would not reflect clinical practice, but labels were verified visually by an expert in dermoscopy. 
                Images of lesions were attributed to patients based on the clinical imaging database identification codes which are stored at the 
                time of capture during each clinical photography session."

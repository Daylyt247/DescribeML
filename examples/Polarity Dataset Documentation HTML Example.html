Yes</p><p>How is distributsed? The dataset is distributed on Bo Pang’s webpage at Cornell: http:
                //www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data. The dataset does
                not have a DOI and there is no redundant archive. The dataset was first released in 2002.</p><p>Past applications: At the time of publication, only the original paper (http://xxx.lanl.
                gov/pdf/cs/0409058v1). Between then and 2012, a collection of papers 
                that used this dataset was maintained at http://www.cs.cornell.
                edu/people/pabo/movie%2Dreview%2Ddata/otherexperiments.html.</p><p>Recommended applications: The dataset could be used for anything related to modeling or
                understanding movie reviews. For instance, one may induce a
                lexicon of words/phrases that are highly indicative of sentiment
                polarity, or learn to automatically generate movie reviews</p><p>Non-recommended: This data is collected solely in the movie review domain, so
                systems trained on it may or may not generalize to other sentiment prediction tasks. 
                Consequently, such systems should not— without additional verification—be used to make consequential
                decisions about people</p></div><div><h3>Keywords</h3><p>Area:  <div>Sentiment</div></p><p>Tags:<div>Movie </div><div>Review </div><div>Sentiment </div><div>Classification </div></p></div><div><h2>Authoring: </h2><div> <h3>Who created the dataset? </h3><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>email</th></tr><tr><td> Bo_Pong</td><td> XXXX@mail.com</td></tr><tr><td> Lillian_Lee</td><td> XXXX@mail.com</td></tr></table></div><div><h3>Who funded the dataset? </h3><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>type</th><th>Grant</th></tr><tr><td>National_Science_Fundations</td><td>mixed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Deparment_of_the_Interior</td><td>public</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>National_Business_Center</td><td>mixed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cornell_University</td><td>mixed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sloan_Fundaiton</td><td>private</td><td></td></tr></table></div><div><h3>Who Maintains the dataset?</h3><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Email</th></tr></table></div></div></div><h2>Composition:</h2><div> <p>Rationale: The instances are movie reviews extracted from newsgroup postings,
            together with a sentiment polarity rating for whether the text
            corresponds to a review with a rating that is either strongly positive (high number of stars)
            or strongly negative (low number of  stars). The sentiment polarity rating is binary {positive, negative}.</p><p>Total Size: 64702</p><div> <p>Instance: MovieReviews</p><p>Description: </p><p>Size: </p><p>Number of attributes: 6</p><p>Type: Record-Data</p><h3>Attributes: </h3><div> <p>Name: fold_id</p><p>Description: Folder Id containing the text inside the dataset </p><p>Count: 64702</p><p>Type: [object Object]</p></div><div> <p>Name: cv_tag</p><p>Description: Author file id containint the text inside the dataset </p><p>Count: 64702</p><p>Type: [object Object]</p></div><div> <p>Name: html_id</p><p>Description: Author file ID separated by pos and negative labels </p><p>Count: 64702</p><p>Type: [object Object]</p></div><div> <p>Name: sent_id</p><p>Description: Sentence id inside every file </p><p>Count: 64702</p><p>Type: [object Object]</p></div><div> <p>Name: text_body</p><p>Description: The text extracted from the revies of IMDB </p><p>Count: 64702</p><p>Type: [object Object]</p></div><div> <p>Name: tag</p><p>Description: The label annotated by the reviewrs </p><p>Type: [object Object]</p></div></div></div><h2>Provenance: </h2><p>Curation Rationale: The data was mostly observable as raw text, except that the
            labels were extracted by the process described below. The
            data was collected by downloading reviews from the IMDb
            archive of the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup, at
            http://reviews.imdb.com/Reviews.</p><h2>Social Concerns </h2><p>Rationale: </p><div> <p>Issue: privacyAware</p><p>Issue Type: Privacy</p><p>Description: Individuals were not aware of data collection. The data was crawled from public web sources,
            and the authors of the posts presumably knew that their posts would be public, but the authors 
            werenot explicitly informed that their posts were to be used in this way.</p></div><div> <p>Issue: inappropiateContent</p><p>Issue Type: Social Impact</p><p>Description: Some movie reviews might contain moderately inappropriate or
            offensive language, but we do not expect this to be the norm</p><p>Related Attributes: [object Object]</p></div><div> <p>Issue: personalInformation</p><p>Issue Type: Privacy</p><p>Description: Some personal information is retained from the newsgroup posting
            in the “raw form” of the dataset (as opposed to the “preprocessed” version, 
            in which these are automatically removed), including the name and email address 
            the author posted under (note that these are already public on the internet newsgroup 
            archive).</p></div></body>
